# 15-projects-of-C
15 projects to learn C language, knowing just the basics.

## DESCRIPTION
This is a personal project, with the objective of learning the C language, here I am doing practice-oriented learning, researching and racking my brain to solve problems.

## MOTIVATION
My motivation for this project is to learn more about the basis of a low-level language that ended up helping in the emergence of other languages, understand pointers and memory manipulation and also challenge myself a little more.

## GOAL
- Learn the basic concepts of the C language.
- Gain familiarity with the syntax and control structures in C.
- Practice problem solving using C.
- Build a solid foundation to explore more advanced topics in C.

This project is for learning purposes only. There is no need for the challenges or projects presented to be suitable for all contexts or to follow best programming practices. i will just use my own judgment to solve problems.
